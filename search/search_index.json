For this project, my goal was to create a smaller form factor keyboard than my current 60%. ## Working with QMK ### Setup Setup of qmk was fairly straight-forward, following the available documentation. <pre><code>pip3 install --user qmk\necho 'PATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\"' &gt;&gt; $HOME/.zshrc &amp;&amp; source $HOME/.zshrc\nqmk setup\nqmk compile -kb clueboard/66/rev3 -km default\n</code></pre>","tags":["projects","keyboard"]},{"location":"projects/keyboards/j6n47/#qmk-configuration","title":"QMK Configuration","text":"<p>I realized I would not be able to reuse the raw data I created earlier in <code>keyboard-layout-editor</code>, so I looked to port over my layout to qmk configuration.</p> <p>I forked the <code>qmk_firmware</code> repo to include my new layout &amp; created a keyboard profile for myself, adding respective pins based on the rpi pico's pinout diagram.  </p> <pre><code>qmk new-keyboard\n...\nqmk compile -kb handwired/j6n47 -km default\n</code></pre> <p>The changes I made can be viewed here.</p> <p>Update: 23/06/30 Went to the library to print the pcb plate! Had to tinker with the fill (make it much less dense than before) to get the print to fit the timeslot I had booked.  Additionally did a test fitting with some spare switches I had lying around. </p> <p>Update: 23/07/04 After flashing the  I wanted the keyboard to also support VIA configuration (that way I won't need to reflash the mcu everytime I want to make changes), enabling support for VIA was surprisingly simple following a guide from youtuber Joe Scotto. </p> <p>Update: 23/07/07 Completed the soldering for the keyboard matrix and microcontroller </p> <p>Update: 23/</p>","tags":["projects","keyboard"]},{"location":"projects/keyboards/j6n47/#references","title":"References","text":"<ul> <li>OLED Display with QMK: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJSOEStpPIo</li> <li>Intro to handwired keyboards: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjml-K-pV4E</li> <li>QMK &amp; VIA support: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7d5yzBOup9U</li> <li>CAD generator for plate: http://www.keyboardcad.com/</li> <li>another cad generator: http://builder.swillkb.com/</li> </ul>","tags":["projects","keyboard"]},{"location":"tags/","title":"Tags","text":"<p>Following is a list of relevant tags:</p>"},{"location":"tags/#airfryer","title":"airfryer","text":"<ul> <li>Chicken Alfredo</li> <li>Chicken Nuggets</li> <li>French Fries</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#dessert","title":"dessert","text":"<ul> <li>Cottage Cheese Ice Cream</li> <li>Strawberry Greek Yogurt</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#drink","title":"drink","text":"<ul> <li>Matcha Latte</li> <li>Pourover Coffee</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#gaming","title":"gaming","text":"<ul> <li>Resources</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#home-server","title":"home server","text":"<ul> <li>Gatus</li> <li>Jellyfin</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#keyboard","title":"keyboard","text":"<ul> <li>j6n43 (WIP)</li> <li>j6n47 (WIP)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#low-carb","title":"low carb","text":"<ul> <li>Cottage Cheese Ice Cream</li> <li>Strawberry Greek Yogurt</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#meal","title":"meal","text":"<ul> <li>Chicken Alfredo</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#meal-prep","title":"meal prep","text":"<ul> <li>Chicken Alfredo</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#projects","title":"projects","text":"<ul> <li>Gatus</li> <li>Jellyfin</li> <li>j6n43 (WIP)</li> <li>j6n47 (WIP)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#protein","title":"protein","text":"<ul> <li>Chicken Alfredo</li> <li>Chicken Nuggets</li> <li>Cottage Cheese Ice Cream</li> <li>Strawberry Greek Yogurt</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#recipe","title":"recipe","text":"<ul> <li>Chicken Alfredo</li> <li>Chicken Nuggets</li> <li>Cottage Cheese Ice Cream</li> <li>Egg Drop Soup</li> <li>French Fries</li> <li>Lobster Tagliatelle</li> <li>Mac and Cheese</li> <li>Matcha Latte</li> <li>Pourover Coffee</li> <li>Strawberry Greek Yogurt</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#sides","title":"sides","text":"<ul> <li>French Fries</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#snack","title":"snack","text":"<ul> <li>Chicken Nuggets</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#soup","title":"soup","text":"<ul> <li>Egg Drop Soup</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#valorant","title":"valorant","text":"<ul> <li>Resources</li> </ul>"}]}
